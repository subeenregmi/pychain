'''
this is how we are going to send a transaction and recieve and the syntax we would need to use

a transaction should include the following:

1) To address
2) From address
3) Amount
4) Validation from to address
5) Any extra data that is needed

We should start by making a function to do so 

then with every transaction we need to create a function to do so and then create a icon

'''class Transaction():

    def __init__(self, _toAddress, _fromAddress, _amount, _validation):
        self.toAddress = str(_toAddress)
        self.fromAddress = str(_fromAddress)
        self.amount = int(_amount)
        self.validation = bool(_validation)

    def verifySpenderIsOwner(_fromAdress, privKey):
        
        verifiedOwner(_fromAdress, privKey)
'''

'''toAddress = ""
fromAddress = ""
amount = ""
validation = False
metaData = ""'''

def createTX(toAddress, fromAddress, amount, metadata):
    pass
